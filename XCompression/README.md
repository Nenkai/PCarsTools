# XCompression

A .NET compression wrapper library for "XMemCompress", commonly found when dealing with Xbox 360 games.

This library takes advantage of the fact that there are native Win32 implementations provided with [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA), not directly exposed, but still accessible with some technical know-how.

XMemCompress appears to be a variant of LZX compression.
