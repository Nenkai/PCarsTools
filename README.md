# PCarsTools

Sets of tools to fully unpack (with file names) and decrypt Project Cars related files.

Should allow fully unpacking with file names:
* TOC Files
* PAK Files

Allows decrypting:
* build.dat
* Scripts

NOTE: Requires oo2core_7_win64 dll file for later games, not included in this repository.

Model encryption was figured but in a seperate tool not currently included.
